# Ironhack
This directory is contains some of the work completed during the Data Analytics bootcamp.<br>

The [Restaurant](https://github.com/nclee17/helloworld/blob/master/03%20-%20Ironhack/01%20Restaurant%20(OOP).ipynb) was a fun exercise to utilise OOP in creating a stimulated restaurant.<br>

The [Shark](https://github.com/nclee17/helloworld/blob/master/03%20-%20Ironhack/02%20Sharks%20(Data%20Cleaning).ipynb) was a project to understand the importance of data cleaning, in particular text mining. This was done before learning regex.

## Projects
A list of some of the projects done during the time at Ironhack:
### 1. [Risk](https://github.com/nclee17/Ironhack_Project1_RISK)<br>
A collaboration project with [Sandrine](https://github.com/srosamont) in making the boardgame, RISK, within 3 days after having only just completed 4 days of the bootcamp.<br><br>
My involvements: 
1. Defining dictionaries for territories, continents and borders
2. Function for Attack and Manoeuvre stage (including the dice roll, check for winner mechanisms etc.)
3. Wrap up everything into one connective game() function (e.g. set up of the game, gameplay, turns mechanisms etc.)

### 2. [Steam](https://github.com/nclee17/helloworld/blob/master/03%20-%20Ironhack/03%20Steam%20(Web%20Scraping).ipynb)<br>
A webscraping project to create a data pipeline using requests, BeautifulSoup, json, selenium. <br>

### 3. [Drugs](https://github.com/nclee17/Drugs)<br>
A project on personality test score and recreational drug consumption.<br> <br>
Techniques:
1. Data Cleaning & Processing (numpy, pandas, sklearn)
2. Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
3. Hypothesis Testing (scipy, pingouin)
4. Supervised Machine Learning (statsmodels, sklearn, xgboost, catboost)

### 4. [Anime Recommendation](https://github.com/BuenofM/Machine-Learning-Anime-Recommendation)<br>
A collaboration project with [Manuela](https://github.com/BuenofM) from a list of anime and its user rating. <br><br>
Techniques:
1. Data Cleaning & Processing (numpy, pandas, sklearn)
2. EDA (pandas_profiling)
3. Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
4. Unsupervised Machine Learning (sklearn, yellowbrick, fcmeans)
5. Superivsed Machine Learning (statsmodels, sklearn)

### 5. [Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/nclee17/Human-Activity-Recognition)<br>
A project on smartphone sensor signals to identify the user's activity.<br><br>
Techniques:
1. Data Processing (numpy, pandas, keras)
2. Data Visualization (matplotlib, mpl_toolkits, seaborn)
3. Deep Machine Learning (sklearn, keras)

## Achievements
The [Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/nclee17/Human-Activity-Recognition) was the final project that was selected to participate in the Hackshow Paris August 2020, which subsequently won the Data Analytics category. The presentation is avaialbe at:
