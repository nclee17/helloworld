# Hello World!
People often erase every traces of their first codes, for me, it is important to document how I have arrived to where I am now. This directory is the story of my coding journey.

## The Origin
### [EY](./01%20-%20EY)
[EY](./01%20-%20EY) is where it all started. The era of google, copy and paste with trial and error method to apply my first Python codes.<br>
Crumbersome huge Excel spreadsheet that often crashes the laptop rendering it almost impossible to clean up. My remit includes some routinal tasks performed on such files, therefore I have my first stumble on Python to make life easier.

### Ironhack
An intensive Data Analytics bootcamp at Ironhack covering data analysis and data science tools and topics.<p>

#### Preparation
The [Ironhack Prep](./02%20-%20Ironhack%20Prep) folder is a requirement for the Ironahck Data Analytics bootcamp program. All prospective students must learn basic Python coding and complete all the challenges set in the folder before being accepted onto the course. It was fun to apply the knowledge into solving different challenges.<p>

In addition to the assignments set by Ironhack, I was eager to try out my newly acquired skills by making little games, e.g. [Hangman](./02%20-%20Ironhack%20Prep/01%20Hangman.ipynb) and [Tic Tac Toe](./02%20-%20Ironhack%20Prep/02%20Tic%20Tac%20Toe.ipynb)<p>

#### [Bootcamp](./03%20-%20Ironhack)
The [Ironhack](./03%20-%20Ironhack) directiory contains early works on OOP and Data Cleaning (before regex), rest of the course material has been removed in consideration for Ironhack intellectual properties.

#### Projects
A list of some of the projects done during the time at Ironhack:
1. [Risk](https://github.com/nclee17/Ironhack_Project1_RISK)
2. [Steam](https://github.com/nclee17/helloworld/blob/master/03%20-%20Ironhack/03%20Steam%20(Web%20Scraping).ipynb) - Web Scraping Project
3. [Drugs](https://github.com/nclee17/Drugs) - Data Visualization, Hypothesis Testing and Supervised Machine Learning Project
4. [Anime Recommendation](https://github.com/BuenofM/Machine-Learning-Anime-Recommendation) - Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning Project
5. [Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/nclee17/Human-Activity-Recognition) - Deep Learning CNN LSTM Project

## The Journey
Equipped with the new skills, it is time to leave the comfort of home (Ironhack) and explore the world.

### Never Stop Learning
This repository will be used for logging the continual studies.
