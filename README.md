# Hello World!
People often erase every traces of their first codes, for me, it is important to document how I have arrived to where I am now. This directory is the story of my coding journey.

## The Origin
### [EY](./01---EY)
[EY](./01---EY) is where it all started. The era of google, copy and paste with trial and error method to apply my first Python codes.<br>
Crumbersome huge Excel spreadsheet that often crashes the laptop rendering it almost impossible to clean up. My remit includes some routinal tasks performed on such files, therefore I have my first stumble on Python to make life easier.

### Ironhack
An intensive Data Analytics bootcamp at Ironhack covering data analysis and data science tools and topics.<p>

#### Preparation
The [Ironhack Prep](./02---Ironhack-Prep) folder is a requirement for the Ironahck Data Analytics bootcamp program. All prospective students must learn basic Python coding and complete all the challenges set in the folder before being accepted onto the course. It was fun to apply the knowledge into solving different challenges.<p>

In addition to the assignments set by Ironhack, I was eager to try out my newly acquired skills by making little games, e.g. [Hangman](./02---Ironhack-Prep/01-Hangman.ipynb) and [Tic Tac Toe](./02---Ironhack-Prep/02-Tic-Tac-Toe)<p>

#### [Training](./03---Ironhack)
The [Ironhack](./03---Ironhack) directiory contains early works on OOP and Data Cleaning (before regex), rest of the course material has been removed in consideration for Ironhack intellectual properties.

#### Projects
A list of some of the projects done during the time at Ironhack:
1. [Risk]()<br>
A collaboration project with [Sandrine](https://github.com/srosamont) in making the boardgame, RISK, within 3 days after having only just completed 4 days of the bootcamp.<br><br>
My involvements: 
    1. Defining dictionaries for territories, continents and borders
    2. Function for Attack and Manoeuvre stage (including the dice roll, check for winner mechanisms etc.)
    3. Wrap up everything into one connective game() function (e.g. set up of the game, gameplay, turns mechanisms etc.)

2. [Steam](./03---Ironhack/03 Steam (Web Scraping).ipynb)<br>
A webscraping project to create a data pipeline using requests, BeautifulSoup, json, selenium. <br> <br>

3. [Drugs](https://github.com/nclee17/Drugs)<br>
A project on personality test score and recreational drug consumption.<br> <br>
Techniques:
    1. Data Cleaning & Processing (numpy, pandas, sklearn)
    2. Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
    3. Hypothesis Testing (scipy, pingouin)
    4. Supervised Machine Learning (statsmodels, sklearn, xgboost, catboost)

4. [Anime](https://github.com/BuenofM/Machine-Learning-Anime-Recommendation)<br>
A collaboration project with [Manuela](https://github.com/BuenofM) from a list of anime and its user rating. <br><br>
Techniques:
    1. Data Cleaning & Processing (numpy, pandas, sklearn)
    2. EDA (pandas_profiling)
    3. Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
    4. Unsupervised Machine Learning (sklearn, yellowbrick, fcmeans)
    5. Superivsed Machine Learning (statsmodels, sklearn)

5. [Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/nclee17/Human-Activity-Recognition)<br>
A project on smartphone sensor signals to identify the user's activity.<br><br>
Techniques:
    1. Data Processing (numpy, pandas, keras)
    2. Data Visualization (matplotlib, mpl_toolkits, seaborn)
    3. Deep Machine Learning (sklearn, keras)

## The Journey
Equipped with the new skills, it is time to leave the comfort of home (Ironhack) and explore the world.

### Never Stop Learning
This repository will be used for logging the continual studies.
